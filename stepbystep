Start with just the variable and an empty hash, run it. 
Then add in the rows key and an empty array and run it. 
Then add in the solution key and empty array and run it. 
Make sure it looks the way you think it should look. Do it like that, a little piece of progress and run it, over and over, until you have it working. 
Then you can experiment with slightly longer durations between runs. These are the fundamentals, you need to practice them.
